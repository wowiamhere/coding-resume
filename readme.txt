				February 2016

	Hello,

My goal as an employee is to assist in any way possible 
	to the success of a project. 
I thrive in my own environment and feel most 
comfortable when in my own space to execute my job duties.

	My personal goal is to develop software remotely.
Current projects: 
*Web Blog (website)
	-bitbucket.org/wowiamhere/latestfashiontrendzblog

		-pass: 'password'

		and all over pages for commenting)

	Ever since high school, I have loved to watch what happens 
inside this machine when I type in an editor the syntax of 
the language being used, compile it and run it.  
I love to program, think about solutions to implement 
in the brainstorming process, and I like to work from home.

I have a logical mentality and a willingness to learn and 
open up to new routines, styles and personalities.  
I am seeking employment to bring my skills to your team, 
to further my career and to expand my experience in different fields.

	Please accept my resume for your consideration.

                            
			Sincerely,
                                                             Sergio S.
