						"Whadda you mean it doesn't compile!!!!!”


					September 2015

	Hello,

		My goal as an employee is to assist in any way possible to the success of a project. I thrive in my own environment and feel most comfortable when in my own space
to execute my job duties.

        After a career in customer service and food &  beverage, I am currently moving into the Programming, Application & Web Development field and wish to bring what I've learned and my capabilities to your projects.
       Ever since high school, I have loved to watch what happens inside this machine when I type in an editor the syntax of the language being used, compile it and run it.  
	I love to program, think about solutions to implement in the brainstorming process, and
I like to work from home.
	I have a logical mentality and a willingness to learn and open up to new routines, styles and personalities.  
	I am seeking employment to bring my skills to your team, to further my career and to expand my experience in different fields.

	Please accept my resume for your consideration.

                            
			Sincerely,
                                                                   
				           Sergio S.
